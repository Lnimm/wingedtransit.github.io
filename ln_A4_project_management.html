      <p>
        Effective project management is critical for a future focused company like Winged Transit. I have gained practical experience managing both team based academic projects and internal software development tasks, ensuring deadlines are met while maintaining quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        During a recent university project, I led a team of five in developing an employee scheduling system. My role included creating documentation, delegating tasks, tracking progress, running weekly check-ins, and adjusting timelines based on stakeholder feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        My core project management skills include:
      </p>
      <ul class="ul-text">
        <li>Scope definition and goal setting.</li>
        <li>Task delegation and time management.</li>
        <li>Risk identification and mitigation planning.</li>
        <li>Agile and Scrum methodology familiarity.</li>
        <li>Stakeholder communication and reporting.</li>
        <li>Team collaboration and conflict resolution</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        These skills help ensure that any internal development or operations project at Winged Transit would be delivered efficiently, aligned with goals, and adaptable to change.
