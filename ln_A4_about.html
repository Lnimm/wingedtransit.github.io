    <h2 class="section-title">Winged Transit â€“ What do we do?</h2>
    <p>Winged Transit is an innovative air taxi company committed to transforming the way people travel across cities and regions. Our core mission is to provide a faster, more efficient alternative to ground-based transport, allowing passengers to bypass traffic congestion and reduce their overall travel time. By using small aircraft that operate on-demand, we help busy professionals, travellers, and everyday commuters reach their destinations with ease.</p>
    <p>Unlike traditional aviation, Winged Transit focuses on short-range flights between key urban and regional locations. Our services are designed to integrate seamlessly into existing travel networks, offering convenient departure and landing locations within or near city centres. This makes air travel accessible not only for business but also for tourism, emergency support, and personal appointments where time matters most.</p>
    <p>At Winged Transit, safety, reliability, and sustainability are at the heart of everything we do. We aim to reduce the environmental impact of short-distance travel by offering a cleaner, more energy-efficient transport solution. Our operations are managed by a dedicated team of aviation professionals, ensuring each flight meets the highest standards of performance and care.</p>
